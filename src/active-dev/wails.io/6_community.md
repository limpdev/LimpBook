# Templates

This page serves as a list for community supported templates. Please submit a PR (click `Edit this page` at the bottom) to include your templates. To build your own template, please see the [Templates](../guides/templates.html) guide.

To use these templates, run `wails init -n "Your Project Name" -t [the link below[@version]]`

If there is no version suffix, the main branch code template is used by default. If there is a version suffix, the code template corresponding to the tag of this version is used.

Example: `wails init -n "Your Project Name" -t https://github.com/misitebao/wails-template-vue`

Attention

**The Wails project does not maintain, is not responsible nor liable for 3rd party templates!**

If you are unsure about a template, inspect `package.json` and `wails.json` for what scripts are run and what packages are installed.

# BulletinBoard

![](../../../../assets/images/bboard-20d8b9dd3b8c4512a0afdd3678eadcc3.webp)

The [BulletinBoard](https://github.com/raguay/BulletinBoard) application is a versital message board for static messages or dialogs to get information from the user for a script. It has a TUI for creating new dialogs that can latter be used to get information from the user. It's design is to stay running on your system and show the information as needed and then hide away. I have a process for watching a file on my system and sending the contents to BulletinBoard when changed. It works great with my workflows. There is also an [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/Alfred%205/EmailIt.alfredworkflow) for sending information to the program. The workflow is also for working with [EmailIt](https://github.com/raguay/EmailIt).

# Modal File Manager

![](../../../../assets/images/modalfilemanager-2bbcd75d8a20921d32bbe1677e9acacd.webp)

[Modal File Manager](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager) is a dual pane file manager using web technologies. My original design was based on NW.js and can be found [here](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager-NWjs). This version uses the same Svelte based frontend code (but it has be greatly modified since the departure from NW.js), but the backend is a [Wails 2](https://wails.io/) implementation. By using this implementation, I no longer use command line `rm`, `cp`, etc. commands, but a git install has to be on the system to download themes and extensions. It is fully coded using Go and runs much faster than the previous versions.

This file manager is designed around the same principle as Vim: a state controlled keyboard actions. The number of states isn't fixed, but very programmable. Therefore, an infinite number of keyboard configurations can be created and used. This is the main difference from other file managers. There are themes and extensions available to download from GitHub.

[October](https://october.utf9k.net) is a small Wails application that makes it really easy to extract highlights from [Kobo eReaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_eReader) and then forward them to [Readwise](https://readwise.io).

It has a relatively small scope with all platform versions weighing in under 10MB, and that's without enabling [UPX compression](https://upx.github.io/)!

In contrast, the author's previous attempts with Electron quickly bloated to several hundred megabytes.

Screenshot of Snippet Expander's Search &amp; Paste window

[Snippet Expander](https://snippetexpander.org) is "Your little expandable text snippets helper", for Linux.

Snippet Expander comprises of a GUI application built with Wails for managing snippets and settings, with a Search &amp; Paste window mode for quickly selecting and pasting a snippet.

The Wails based GUI, go-lang CLI and vala-lang auto expander daemon all communicate with a go-lang daemon via D-Bus. The daemon does the majority of the work, managing the database of snippets and common settings, and providing services for expanding and pasting snippets etc.

Check out the [source code](https://git.sr.ht/~ianmjones/snippetexpander/tree/trunk/item/cmd/snippetexpandergui/app.go#L38) to see how the Wails app sends messages from the UI to the backend that are then sent to the daemon, and subscribes to a D-Bus event to monitor changes to snippets via another instance of the app or CLI and show them instantly in the UI via a Wails event.
