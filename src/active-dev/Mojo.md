# Mojo ⨠ Python Superset

> **Up to 35,000x faster than vanilla Python**

- Owner/Borrower system w/ a checker, like `Rust`
- Manual Memory Management, featuring pointer arithmetic and reference counting, with a garbage collector for automatic memory management

## Addition: `struct`

Like Rust, Go, and in mirroring Typescript, Mojo introduces a **typed language** that provides a rich set of features for building high-performance applications.

- `var` ⇾ mutable
- `let` ⇾ immutable
- `SIMD` ⇾ 'Single Instruction Multiple Data', enables vectorization of multiple instructions, and enables parallel processing of data. This feature allows for efficient computation on large datasets and accelerates performance in various applications.
