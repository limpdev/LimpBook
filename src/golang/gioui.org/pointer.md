### Overview [¶](#pkg-overview "Go to Overview")

- [Hit areas](#hdr-Hit_areas)
- [Matching events](#hdr-Matching_events)
- [Pass-through](#hdr-Pass_through)
- [Disambiguation](#hdr-Disambiguation)
- [Priorities](#hdr-Priorities)

Package pointer implements pointer events and operations. A pointer is either a mouse controlled cursor or a touch object such as a finger.

The [event.Op](/gioui.org@v0.8.0/io/event#Op) operation is used to declare a handler ready for pointer events.

#### Hit areas [¶](#hdr-Hit_areas "Go to Hit areas")

Clip operations from package [op/clip](/op/clip) are used for specifying hit areas where handlers may receive events.

For example, to set up a handler with a rectangular hit area:

```
r := image.Rectangle{...}
area := clip.Rect(r).Push(ops)
event.Op{Tag: h}.Add(ops)
area.Pop()
```

Note that hit areas behave similar to painting: the effective area of a stack of multiple area operations is the intersection of the areas.

BUG: Clip operations other than clip.Rect and clip.Ellipse are approximated with their bounding boxes.

#### Matching events [¶](#hdr-Matching_events "Go to Matching events")

Areas form an implicit tree, with input handlers as leaves. The children of an area is every area and handler added between its Push and corresponding Pop.

For example:

```
ops := new(op.Ops)
var h1, h2 *Handler

area := clip.Rect(...).Push(ops)
event.Op(Ops, h1)
area.Pop()

area := clip.Rect(...).Push(ops)
event.Op(Ops, h2)
area.Pop()
```

implies a tree of two inner nodes, each with one pointer handler attached.

The matching proceeds as follows.

First, the foremost area that contains the event is found. Only areas whose parent areas all contain the event is considered.

Then, every handler attached to the area is matched with the event.

If all attached handlers are marked pass-through or if no handlers are attached, the matching repeats with the next foremost (sibling) area. Otherwise the matching repeats with the parent area.

In the example above, all events will go to h2 because it and h1 are siblings and none are pass-through.

#### Pass-through [¶](#hdr-Pass_through "Go to Pass-through")

The PassOp operations controls the pass-through setting. All handlers added inside one or more PassOp scopes are marked pass-through.

Pass-through is useful for overlay widgets. Consider a hidden side drawer: when the user touches the side, both the (transparent) drawer handle and the interface below should receive pointer events. This effect is achieved by marking the drawer handle pass-through.

#### Disambiguation [¶](#hdr-Disambiguation "Go to Disambiguation")

When more than one handler matches a pointer event, the event queue follows a set of rules for distributing the event.

As long as the pointer has not received a Press event, all matching handlers receive all events.

When a pointer is pressed, the set of matching handlers is recorded. The set is not updated according to the pointer position and hit areas. Rather, handlers stay in the matching set until they no longer appear in a InputOp or when another handler in the set grabs the pointer.

A handler can exclude all other handler from its matching sets by setting the Grab flag in its InputOp. The Grab flag is sticky and stays in effect until the handler no longer appears in any matching sets.

The losing handlers are notified by a Cancel event.

For multiple grabbing handlers, the foremost handler wins.

#### Priorities [¶](#hdr-Priorities "Go to Priorities")

Handlers know their position in a matching set of a pointer through event priorities. The Shared priority is for matching sets with multiple handlers; the Grabbed priority indicate exclusive access.

Priorities are useful for deferred gesture matching.

Consider a scrollable list of clickable elements. When the user touches an element, it is unknown whether the gesture is a click on the element or a drag (scroll) of the list. While the click handler might light up the element in anticipation of a click, the scrolling handler does not scroll on finger movements with lower than Grabbed priority.

Should the user release the finger, the click handler registers a click.

However, if the finger moves beyond a threshold, the scrolling handler determines that the gesture is a drag and sets its Grab flag. The click handler receives a Cancel (removing the highlight) and further movements for the scroll handler has priority Grabbed, scrolling the list.
