This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

This cheatsheet is specifically *Markdown Here's* version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a *Markdown Here* email, but it should be pretty close.

You can play around with Markdown on our [live demo page](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

(If you're not a Markdown Here user, check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./Markdown-Cheatsheet) that is not specific to MDH. But, really, you should also use Markdown Here, because it's awesome. http://markdown-here.com)

Testing inline SVG icons here: [icon-chase] → bracketted 'icon-' + whatever the desired icon is. *Must be designated within the page's `CSS`*. For this book, the definitions should be in the `variables.css` file as part of the theme.

## Emphasis

```bash
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

```bash
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```bash
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github).
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Again, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

<a name="tables"/>

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| *Still*  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |
```

## Blockquotes

```no-highlight
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
```

<a name="html"/>

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```no-highlight
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="hr"/>

## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...

(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)

<a name="videos"/>

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```no-highlight
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```no-highlight
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

## TeX Mathematical Formulae

A full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet. Here's a [good reference](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics), and you can try stuff out on [CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php). You can also play with formulae in the Markdown Here options page.

Here are some examples to try out:

```
$$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$$
$$x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$$
$$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$$
```

$$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$$

$$x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$$

$$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$$

The beginning and ending dollar signs (`$`) are the delimiters for the TeX markup.

#### `WIDGETS` | TRADING VIEW

Adding some dope ass widget resources _because why the fuck not_.

> [!NOTE]
> You can NOT embed widgets like these as iframes, it violates the Geneva Convention Cross-Site Man in the Middle of Traffic Act of 1863.

SO instead... make an HTML file with the widgets... iframe THAT shit instead!
