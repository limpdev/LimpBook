### AskReddit

- North Shore is more pricey and feels more exclusive, while the South Shore is filled with resorts and feels more homey
- **==🟡GRAND HYATT==** HAS THE BEST POOL ON THE ISLAND. So popular that they offer it on ResortPass for daily fees. Must see (or stay?).
- **IT WILL RAIN EVERYDAY, YOU’RE A FOOL TO EXPECT OTHERWISE**
- Not as ‘beachy’ of a place as you would think… Concerns over natural phenomena? Pathogens? ← *CONFIRM THIS*
- Apparently ***tubing*** is fucking great. Go figure.
