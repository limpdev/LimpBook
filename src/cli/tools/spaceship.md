## ü§ù Requirements

Before we begin, let's make sure you have the following installed:

-   [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) (v5.2 or recent) must be installed. Run the following command to check your version of Zsh:

    ```shell
    echo $ZSH_VERSION #> 5.8.1
    ```

-   [Powerline Font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (even better) must be installed and used in your terminal. [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is a popular choice. To check if Powerline Font works for you, run:

    ```shell
    echo -e "\xee\x82\xa0" #> ÓÇ†
    ```


## üöÄ Installation
