# LimpBook

> [!NOTE]
> All the `docs` I need in one place -> **Formatted for usage with `mdbook`**.

Assuming `mdbook` is installed, along with `rust` and `cargo` of course...

#### Building the Docset

```bash
mdbook build
```

- Documentation will be built using specifications from `theme` into `HTML` -> available in the newly created `book` directory. Begin at `/book/index.html`...
